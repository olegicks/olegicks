## 👤 Who am I?

I am a Computer Science student with a primary focus on backend development and API-driven systems.  
I enjoy designing clean architectures, understanding how systems behave under real conditions, and writing code that is maintainable rather than simply functional.

My main interest lies in Python-based development, especially around web technologies, data handling, and service-oriented design.  
I value clarity, consistency, and simple solutions to complex problems.

## 🚧 What am I currently working on?

I spend most of my time improving backend-related skills and deepening practical knowledge:

- Building and refining REST APIs  
- Working with Django & Django REST Framework  
- Exploring database design and query efficiency  
- Using Docker for reproducible environments  
- Strengthening code structure, readability, and testing practices  

I typically focus on projects that mirror real application scenarios rather than isolated exercises.
